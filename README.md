### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (The coolest lesson I learned here was how to combine a javascript file and a HTML file to create a coherent website.)
2. (I learned how truly helpful commenting is with this assignment. My C# scripting is 10x more difficult to read because I dont comment to the extent that these files are commented on but now I realize just how much of a better time i'll have with commenting like this)
3. (I learned to conceptualize the teamwork and shared variables between two files like never before.)
